# Gesture-Controlled Debian System with Google's MediaPipe and i3wm

![Gesture-Controlled Debian System](https://example.com/your_image.png)

## Introduction

This project combines the power of Google's MediaPipe library for gesture recognition with the efficient window management of i3wm on Debian-based systems. With this system, users can interact with their desktop environment using intuitive hand gestures, offering a novel and efficient way to control their Debian system.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilize MediaPipe's advanced machine learning models to accurately recognize a variety of hand gestures.
  
- **i3wm Integration**: Seamlessly control window placement, workspace switching, and other desktop actions using gestures within the i3wm environment.

- **Customizable Controls**: Personalize gesture actions according to your preferences, allowing for a tailored user experience.

- **Efficient Performance**: Benefit from the efficiency and performance of both MediaPipe and i3wm, ensuring smooth and responsive gesture-based control without compromising system resources.

- **Open-Source and Extensible**: The project is open-source, welcoming contributions to enhance functionality, add new gestures, and improve compatibility with different Debian-based systems.

## Getting Started
